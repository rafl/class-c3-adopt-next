    lazy people who only read the verbatim sections (abraxxa).

  * Add ability to disable warnings for an entire set of modules using a
    regex.
  * Change warnings to use the caller instead of the class name of the
    instance so that warnings are reported on the class which actually
    uses NEXT, not the class which inherits from it.

  * Update documentation.

  * Install our hacked version of NEXT::AUTOLOAD into NEXT::ACTUAL::AUTOLOAD
    too. This makes us work with NEXT 0.61, which doesn't do all of its magic
    in NEXT::AUTOLOAD anymore (closes RT#41467).
